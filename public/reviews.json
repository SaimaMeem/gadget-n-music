      "review": "These little things pack one hell of a punch!\n Apple’s new noise cancellation and transparency modes lay the groundwork for a new generation of wireless headphones. Yes others may have used similar technology before, but Apple’s simplistic UI made for the airpods pro make the experience so much better than what other companies offer. <br></br> Coming from the first generation airpods, the experience is like night and day.",

      "review": "Well for 6 month these were great headphones....Then the left driver blew with normal use...I took a look on the inside and it was obvious why. Although the outer shell is made well, the innards are of very poor quality. Sub-standard drivers, badly soldered connections and cheap wire (the only thing keeping the wire from pulling loose is the fact that it is tied in a knot inside the housing.",

      "review": "I love mines. For £4 shipped I wasn't expecting much, but these babies are well built and actually sound decent even for music! I could listen all day long. No buzzing in the drivers like junk headphones. They are not very sensitive so you have to crank the volume up a little more than other headphones. Especially for children, youtube etc these are winners! They weigh nothing and are very comfortable, bravo KOSS!",

Just save the money you were to invest, and the money from any case you would buy, and purchase another product instead!",

Another reviewer mentioned to stretch them out by leaving them around a sofa armrest or something like that, and after doing that, I haven't had any trouble with my ears hurting.\r\n",

I bought these intending to plug them into my guitar amp in order to listen to myself playing without bothering the family and neighbors.But, this pair of headphones feel like a real waste of money.\r\n",
